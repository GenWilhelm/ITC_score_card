		["Headhunter", "1pt for each enemy ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ that is destroyed."],
		["Kingslayer", "Choose an enemy model that is a ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ.\n- Earn 1 point for every 2 wounds of damage it loses, cumulatively.\n- In the instance where a ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ may regenerate wounds or resurrect during the course of the game, total wounds it loses over the course of the game are counted towards this mission.\n- If the model selected has the ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ and ᴠᴇʜɪᴄʟᴇ or ᴍᴏɴsᴛᴇʀ keywords, you earn 1 point for every 4 wounds it loses instead of 1 for every 2.\n- If the ᴄʜᴀʀᴀᴄᴛᴇʀ is also your opponent’s Warlord, earn 1 additional point (to a maximum of 4 total) if it is destroyed."],
		["Marked for Death", "Choose 4 of your opponent’s units with a Power Level of 7+. Earn 1 pt for each of these units destroyed.\n- In order to score this point against a unit that splits into multiple units during the course of play, you must destroy each individual component unit. If a unit joins with another unit during the course of play, to earn this point you must destroy the entire conjoined unit."],
		["Titan Slayers", "For every 8 wounds lost by enemy units with the ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ keyword in total throughout the course of the game, earn 1 point regardless of wounds being “healed” or “regenerated” etc. You may choose when to count wounds dealt to any one ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ model but as soon as you do, that model will no longer yield points for any other non-stacking secondary mission.\n[i]Example: One enemy ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ model loses 4 wounds turn 1, and a different enemy ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ unit loses 12 wounds turn 2 for a total of 16 wounds lost in total to enemy ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ models. You choose to count those wounds and earn 2pts towards this objective but neither of those ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ units may give up points for other secondary missions that require destroying an enemy unit.[/i]"],
		["Gang Busters", "For every 6 wounds inflicted on a multi-model unit composed entirely of models with 3 or more wounds, score 1 point. Units with the sᴡᴀʀᴍ keyword do not count towards this mission."],
		["Big Game Hunter", "1 point for every enemy model with the ᴍᴏɴsᴛᴇʀ or ᴠᴇʜɪᴄʟᴇ keyword and 7+ wounds destroyed."],
		["Pick Your Poison", "Pick up to four keywords from the following list: ᴘsʏᴋᴇʀ, ғʟʏ, ʙɪᴋᴇʀ, ᴠᴇʜɪᴄʟᴇ, ᴍᴏɴsᴛᴇʀ, ᴛɪᴛᴀɴɪᴄ. You cannot pick a keyword more than once. For each keyword you pick, nominate an enemy unit with that keyword, you cannot nominate a unit for more than 1 keyword. Score 1 point for each nominated unit that is destroyed."],
		["The Butcher’s Bill", "Destroy 2+ enemy units during a player turn to earn 1 Point."],
		["*The Reaper", "For every 20 enemy models destroyed, earn 1 point. \n- You count each model when they are destroyed. In the instance of models coming back into play after being destroyed during the course of a game, you may count them each time they are destroyed.\n- Destroyed models are allowed to accrue points for The Reaper and any other <Secondary Mission> regardless of asterisk, except Marked for Death."],
		["*Recon", "Have a unit at least partially in each table quarter at the end of your player turn. A unit may only count as being in one table quarter at a time for the purposes of this rule. 1pt per turn."],
		["*Behind Enemy Lines", "If at least one of your units is entirely in the enemy Deployment Zone at the start of your turn, earn 1 Point. A unit is entirely within if every model in the unit is at least partially in the enemy Deployment Zone."],
		["*Ground Control", "Earn 1 point for each objective held at the end of the last Battle Round played."],
		["*King of the Hill", "At the end of the Battle Round the player who chose this secondary scores 1 point if they have two non-character, multi-model, units wholly within 6 inches of the centre of the table. Units that score King of the Hill cannot score Recon, Ground Control, or Engineers. Multi-model in this instance means a unit that began the game with more than 1 model."],
		["*Engineers", "Select two non-character/non-fortification units from your army to be Engineers. Starting from Battle Round 2, if either of these units starts and ends your turn within 3” of an objective marker you control, and it did not make any attacks or manifest any psychic powers during your turn, earn 1 point at the end of that turn. These units may not score this objective if they join other units during the course of play or split into multiple units. Units chosen to be Engineers may never benefit from a rule that keeps them from being the target of attacks, Cloud of Flies, for example. They can benefit from terrain blocking Line of Sight to them."],
		["*Old School", "Earn 1 point for the following:\n- First Strike: An enemy unit is destroyed in the first Battle Round.\n- Slay the Warlord: The enemy Warlord is destroyed at game’s end.\n- Linebreaker: Have one of your models within your opponent’s deployment zone at the end of the game.\n- Last Strike: An enemy unit is destroyed in the last Battle Round played."]
